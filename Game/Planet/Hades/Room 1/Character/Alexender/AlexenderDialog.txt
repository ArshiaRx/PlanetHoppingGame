Don’t worry lad, I can fix it up. However, you are going to have to find a way to 
pay me back. So, I suggest as you wait for repairs, you go hunt down a 
A monster named the diamond-tailed wolf, which lives east of here. But, I don’t think
That's enough to cover the cost so, I recommend you look around for another piece of 
Treasure. The easiest one to find would be a red diamond that should fully cover the
Cost. When you find one hand it over to me.
