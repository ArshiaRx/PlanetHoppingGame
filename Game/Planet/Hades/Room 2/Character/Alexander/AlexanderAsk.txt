You ask if anyone else that lives around here

To my knowledge, I am the only one who dares live here as a matter of fact I am a
jewels dealer. You see this planet is filled with rare crystals and jewels that I sell to the
Wider galaxy. Every so often a group or an individual comes by to try and collect
some treasure some are successful, others are not. I also sell other
stuff like spaceship parts
